# Culture

## Open Doors

Make time for anyone who asks

Leaders should have opens doors to anyone at any level

## Employee Voice Committee (EVC)

Sometimes it is difficult to approach leadership and open doors aren't enough.
The employee voice comittee is a small comittee of one member from each department.
The committee meets at some frequency with the CEO to discuss questions concerns people from their department have.

## Employee Resource Groups (ERG)

Resource groups for employees with common goals, challenges, or interests; in and out of the workplace.

Examples:
* addiction and recovery
* working parents and caregivers
* financial planning and independence
* mindfulness

## Flexible Time
* We don't exist to punch a clock
* Commit and deliver
* Life comes first
* Be available during core hours

## On Call
* You are not house bound
* If you'll be away, let a teammate know, use overrides
* Support the oncall if they need to step away
* Rotate early if there are major incidents, don't overload the oncall
* Take time off to make up for oncall responses if they become extensive

## Sync and Async Effectively
* Meetings should have an agenda
* Messages should contain the ask, request, or statement, "hey" is not effective asyc communication
* Set your status and keep your calendar up to date

## Unlimited PTO
* Should not just be an accounting trick
* Everyone should take a minimum of 5 days per quarter
* There is no maximum, use your PTO
* Log your PTO, log your sick days, log your jury duty
* Mental health days are sick days
* Commit and deliver; excel and recharge

## Wellness

We all perform our best when we are physically and mentally healthy. Being well comes before work.
